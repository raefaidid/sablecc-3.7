# Group Project CSC569

## Requirements

1. Create a compiler/programming language similar to the Decaf compiler/programming language but change as many as possible the terminal symbols.
2. Name your compiler, and the compiler's name becomes your group name.
3. 3/4 members per group.
4. Add a new control statement to your compiler:
   ```
   DoWhileStmt → do Stmt while (BoolExpr)
   ```

## Sample Program

Recreate the following Decaf program using your compiler/programming language and run the program.

```java
class NewComp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        float X1, Y1;
        int I, J, K;
        X1 = 0;
        Y1 = 10;
        K = 10;
        J = -10;

        for (I = 1; I + 10 <= K; I = I - 1) {
            while (K + I < 20) {
                J = I;
                do {
                    if (X1 > Y1)
                        J = J - 2;
                    else
                        J = J / 4;
                    X1 = X1 * 2.0;
                } while (J >= 20);
                K = K + 3;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
